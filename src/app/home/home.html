<h2>What's this?</h2>

    Appoints is an appointment scheduling sample application that hopefully provides a bit of guidance 
    into the wild west that is called 'Modern Day Web Development'. It consists of a 
    <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> REST API backend and an 
    <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> frontend, so it's totally buzzword-compliant. Apart from that, 
    JavaScript, Node.js and Angular simply rock and make it very much possible to build clean, testable and maintainable apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following design decisions have been taken:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep it as simple as possible</li>
      <li>Totally separated <a href="https://github.com/martijnboland/appoints-client">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/martijnboland/appoints-api-node">server API</a>, no state;</li>
      <li>JWT Token based authentication/authorization;</li>
      <li>No local user accounts, only 3rd party (Facebook & Google implemented);</li>
      <li>REST API with a touch of hypermedia (<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>);</li>
      <li>Client build step with <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, no messing with bundles, asset pipeline or requirejs.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Where to go next?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#/appointments">Schedule some appointments</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/martijnboland/appoints-api-node">Go to the appoints-api GitHub project (and perhaps write a client for it?)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/martijnboland/appoints-client">Go to the appoints-client GitHub project (this application)</a></li>
    </ul>
